/*
 * This class represents a standard, 3x3 tic-tac-toe board. In this project these 
 * serve only to work with the standard Board, but they are stand-alone classes and 
 * are independently tested, so they could be used in an ordinary tic-tac-toe game. 
 * 
 * The board uses indices 0-8, where the top-left box is 0, the bottom-right is 8, 
 * and everything in between is numbered left to right and top to bottom, where row 
 * is more significant than column. 
 *  
 * To illustrate: 
 * +-+-+-+
 * |0|1|2|
 * +-+-+-+
 * |3|4|5|
 * +-+-+-+
 * |6|7|8|
 * +-+-+-+
 * 
 * It may not be truly representative of what happens in a real Tic-Tac-Toe game to 
 * have the SmallBoard class be responsible for determining what a valid move is and 
 * who wins the board, but it makes a lot more sense programmatically to handle the 
 * logic this way. 
 * 
 * The SmallBoard class is extremely similar to the Board class, but I couldn't see 
 * any meaningful way to inherit behavior without a lot of ugliness (and even then, 
 * maybe not)
